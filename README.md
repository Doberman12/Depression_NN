DepressionNN – Neural Network for Depression Detection

Overview
DepressionNN is a machine learning project that utilizes a neural network to detect signs of depression based on input data. 
The model is trained on relevant datasets and uses deep learning techniques to analyze patterns and predict potential depressive symptoms.

Features
Neural Network-Based Model – Uses deep learning for classification.
Data Preprocessing – Includes feature engineering and normalization.
Performance Evaluation – Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualization – Graphs and charts for model interpretation.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
NumPy & Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn

Model Performance
The DepressionNN model achieves an impressive 97% accuracy, 
demonstrating its strong predictive capabilities. 
This high performance indicates that the model effectively recognizes depression-related patterns in the dataset.
